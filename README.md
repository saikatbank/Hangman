# Hangman Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Hangman game in Python. It's a console-based game where the player tries to guess a word by suggesting letters within a certain number of attempts.

## Rules:

- You have a limited number of attempts to guess the word.
- Enter single letters as your guesses.
- If you guess a correct letter, it will be revealed in the word.
- If you make too many incorrect guesses, you lose the game.

## Features

- Randomly selects a word from a predefined list.
- Keeps track of guessed letters and remaining attempts.
- Provides feedback on the current state of the word.
